# Frugo Theme

![frugo](dark-logo.png)

Minimalist Hugo theme meant to be used for static blogs and personal website. I made it for my friend Freddie initially, but feel free to use it for yours too :)

Check out [Freddie's portfolio](https://github.com/wickedjargon/)!

## Features

- Tagged Blogs, for taxonomical categorization

## Installation

To install Hugo on your OS, feel free to checkout [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/installation/) from official Hugo Website.

Also checkout [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for quick setup.

> If you are willing to use Frugo theme, make sure to run the following commands instead of the one on the guide i.e., `ananke` related.

### Add Frugo Theme:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/Karunika/frugo.git themes/frugo
```

### Configuration

```
echo "theme = 'frugo'" >> hugo.toml
```
